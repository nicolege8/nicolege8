Hi, I’m Nicole Ge, a current student at Harvey Mudd College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I’m interested in AI and machine learning, with experience integrating agentic workflows, RAG, NLP and computer vision. I’m currently learning web development, game development, and connecting AI with computer graphics!
